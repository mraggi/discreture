/**
 *Welcome to discreture. This is a short tutorial on some of the functions
 *provided by discreture. Remember that discreture is a header-only library,
 *which means there is no need to install anything: You can simply copy the
 *folder "include" to your project and start using it right away.
 *
 *It's assumed you already know C++. Compile this file with "g++ -std=c++14
 *tutorial.cpp -o tutorial"
 *
 *If you get an error "fatal error: discreture.hpp: No such file or directory"
 *it means your compiler doesn't know where to find discreture. Fix it by
 *compiling with "g++ -std=c++14 -I/path/to/discreture/include tutorial.cpp -o
 *tutorial"
 *
 *For more details about installing, compiling, etc. see README.md.
 *
 *Finally, if you need help, feel free to email me at mraggi@gmail.com

     *A few important notes:
     *1. It works with any random-access container, such as std::vector
     *2. It does not check for repeats! So if you do combinations on
     *"aaaaa", it will just produce many sets with "aaa".
     *3. The std::string is necessary, because "abcde" is not a proper
     *container. It's an C-style char array.
